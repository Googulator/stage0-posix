run kaem.run to build the bootstrap mescc-tools binaries without referencing any eternal programs
kaem-optional-seed can be used to do that, as can any standard shell.

at this time there are only 2 generated files in this repo:
kaem-optional-seed (not required can be removed or ignored if you have a shell you trust)
hex0-seed (you can build this from the hex0.hex0 source file and it should be bit for bit identical regardless of host)

Please make sure to clone:
https://github.com/oriansj/M2-Planet
and
https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/mescc-tools

As the stages after cc_x86 is built depend upon those folders to build the C versions.
