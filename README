run kaem.run to build the bootstrap mescc-tools, M2-Planet and mes-m2 binaries
without referencing any eternal programs. kaem-optional-seed can be used to do
that, as can any standard shell.

or you can manually run each step by hand after reading a printed copy of the
kaem.run for the bootstrap you wish to verify

at this time there are only 3 generated files in this repo:
kaem-optional-seed (not required can be removed or ignored if you have a shell you trust)
x86/hex0-seed (you can build this from the x86/hex0.hex0 source file and it should be bit for bit identical regardless of host)
AMD64/hex0-seed (you can build this from the AMD64/hex0.hex0 source file and it should be bit for bit identical regardless of host)

Please make sure to do git clone --recursive to get M2-Planet and mescc-tools as
they are the C sources built

If however you desire to use NASM to verify and bootstrap instead, those files
are in their respective architecture's folder named NASM.

Should you wish to enhance any of the files, the M1 sources can be found in the
Development folders in each respective architecture.
