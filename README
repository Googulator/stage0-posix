run kaem.run to build the bootstrap mescc-tools binaries without referencing any eternal programs
kaem-optional-seed can be used to do that, as can any standard shell.

or you can manually run each step by hand after reading a printed copy of the kaem.run for the bootstrap you wish to verify

at this time there are only 3 generated files in this repo:
kaem-optional-seed (not required can be removed or ignored if you have a shell you trust)
x86/hex0-seed (you can build this from the x86/hex0.hex0 source file and it should be bit for bit identical regardless of host)
AMD64/hex0-seed (you can build this from the AMD64/hex0.hex0 source file and it should be bit for bit identical regardless of host)

Please make sure to do git clone --recursive to get M2-Planet and mescc-tools as they are the C sources built
