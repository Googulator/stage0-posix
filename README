run kaem.run to build the bootstrap mescc-tools binaries without referencing any eternal programs
kaem-optional-seed can be used to do that, as can any standard shell.

at this time there are only 3 generated files in this repo:
kaem-optional-seed (not required can be removed or ignored if you have a shell you trust)
hex0-seed (you can build this from the hex0.hex0 source file and it should be bit for bit identical regardless of host)
